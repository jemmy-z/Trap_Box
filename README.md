Running instructions: Trap_Box.exe Trap_Box.cfg

Description:

A 3D GUI created in the language of C++. Using the FLTK library, this gui demonstrates elastic collisions between balls trapped inside a cube box. Initially there is only a wired box, until the user clicks "Add Ball" This continues until the maximum number of balls has been reached. This number is set in the Trap_Box.cfg file. In addition the size of each ball can be controlled via the Trap_Box.cfg file. Once created, the balls flow towards the center of the cube and once inside the box, it cannot leave--hence Trap Box.
